## About Project

SustainableStitch is a project that aims to revolutionize the cloth manufacturing industry. Our platform serves as a catalyst for positive change by providing small-scale cloth manufacturers with a direct connection to local shops. Through SustainableStitch, cloth manufacturers can showcase their unique products and establish transparent and fair trade relationships with local retailers.

## Flow
