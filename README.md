## About Project

SustainableStitch is a project that aims to revolutionize the cloth manufacturing industry. Our platform serves as a catalyst for positive change by providing small-scale cloth manufacturers with a direct connection to local shops. Through SustainableStitch, cloth manufacturers can showcase their unique products and establish transparent and fair trade relationships with local retailers.

## Flow

- Product Showcase: Cloth manufacturers can create captivating product listings, including detailed descriptions, high-quality images, and pricing information. They can showcase their unique offerings to attract potential buyers.

- Search and Discovery: Local shops can explore the SustainableStitch platform and discover a wide range of products offered by cloth manufacturers. They can browse through different categories, apply filters, and find products that align with their store's style and target audience.

- Secure Blockchain Transactions: SustainableStitch leverages the CELO blockchain to ensure secure and tamper-proof transactions. Manufacturers and local shops can execute transactions for product purchases, with the assurance of a trusted and decentralized environment.

## Development Challenges

During the development process, our team encountered various challenges that required innovative solutions. Integrating the CELO blockchain while ensuring the security and transparency of transactions was a significant hurdle. We overcame this obstacle by implementing robust smart contracts and conducting thorough auditing and testing. Additionally, designing an intuitive UI/UX experience that catered to the needs of both cloth manufacturers and local shops required careful consideration and iterative design processes. üöÄüí°‚ú®

_\* The integration of all things together was the major part we wanted to make sure that it is easy to contribute._
