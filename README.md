## About Project

SustainableStitch is a project that aims to revolutionize the cloth manufacturing industry. Our platform serves as a catalyst for positive change by providing small-scale cloth manufacturers with a direct connection to local shops. Through SustainableStitch, cloth manufacturers can showcase their unique products and establish transparent and fair trade relationships with local retailers.

## Flow

- Registration and Onboarding: Cloth manufacturers and local shops can sign up for SustainableStitch by creating their accounts. They provide relevant information about their business, including contact details and product categories.

- Product Showcase: Cloth manufacturers can create captivating product listings, including detailed descriptions, high-quality images, and pricing information. They can showcase their unique offerings to attract potential buyers.

- Search and Discovery: Local shops can explore the SustainableStitch platform and discover a wide range of products offered by cloth manufacturers. They can browse through different categories, apply filters, and find products that align with their store's style and target audience.

- Secure Blockchain Transactions: SustainableStitch leverages the CELO blockchain to ensure secure and tamper-proof transactions. Manufacturers and local shops can execute transactions for product purchases, with the assurance of a trusted and decentralized environment.
